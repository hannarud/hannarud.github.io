Here we have a magic link to the path by itself (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/the-most-comprehensive-data-science-learning-plan-for-2017/).

I just decided to start from somewhere and took a [skilltest in Machine Learning](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/skilltest-machine-learning-2/). 20 points for me - fair enough as I do not think I'm good at it now. Highly recommended. Or at least revise the [answers to the problems of first skilltest in ML](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/11/solution-for-skilltest-machine-learning-revealed/).

After that I had to make an introductory presentation on TensorFlow for my colleagues (I think, this will appear in the blog as well) - that's why I needed some practical examples and went to Kaggle. Haven't been there for a long time. That was the best decision I ever could take. Now I own my TensorFlow example repo ([have a look at it](https://github.com/hannarud/kaggle-titanic-tensorflow)) and a [second-level profile on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hannarud) (hungry for more!).

And yes! The main goal of this article was to present a huge & nice infographics of my learning path 2017 ([see on AV page](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/learning-plan-2017-intermediates-data-science/))!

### Wait a moment for the infographics to load!
